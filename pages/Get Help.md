<p><strong>Supporting patients requiring financial assistance</strong>
</p>
<p>Singaporeans aged 60 and above with disabling hearing loss may be eligible
for the <strong>Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF)</strong>. Audiologists
can assist patients in checking their household means-testing (HHMT) outcomes
to determine eligibility and facilitate the application process for SMF
in purchasing hearing devices.</p>
<p>The subsidy provided by SMF is capped at $3,000, with varying percentages
of 0%, 75%, 90% and 100%, depending on the HHMT and any social service
assistance the patient may be receiving. In cases where the cost of the
hearing device(s) exceeds $3,000, the patient would pay the remaining balance
after deducting the subsidy. The prices of hearing aids can range from
$900 to $12,000 for a pair.</p>
