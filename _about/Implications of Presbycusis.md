<p>The consequences of leaving the condition untreated can be profound. Untreated
hearing loss can spiral into diminished life quality and elevated risks
of cognitive disorders.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Fall-related injuries</strong>
</p>
<p>People with hearing loss have diminished auditory cues (like footsteps,
voices, or traffic) and often need to focus harder on understanding sounds
and speech. This reduced spatial awareness and additional cognitive effort
may divert attention away from maintaining balance or noticing potential
hazards, thus increasing the likelihood of a fall.</p>
<p>Falls in older adults can lead to injuries, hospitalisations, and a loss
of independence.</p>

<p><strong>Social isolation</strong>
</p>
<p>Untreated hearing loss often results in communication difficulties, affecting
social interactions with loved ones and friends. This can result in increased
frustration when interacting with patients with presbycusis. Difficulties
with communication may eventually reduce interactions and participation
in enjoyable activities, resulting in increased loneliness and quality
of life among these patients.</p>

<p><strong>Cognitive decline &amp; Dementia</strong>
</p>
<p>A study based in the United States found that the risk of incident dementia
was 1.89 times higher in elderly with mild hearing loss, and 4.94 times
higher in elderly with severe hearing loss.</p>
<p>Locally, a longitudinal study involving 1,515 subjects found that among
participants who were cognitively normal at baseline, those with hearing
impairment were 2.3 times more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment
or dementia.</p>
<p>Although the mechanisms via which this occurs are not fully elucidated,
there are several proposed theories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social isolation may result in reduced cognitive stimulation, predisposing
one to decline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has also been proposed that hearing impairment requires the brain to
recruit finite neurologic reserve to make up for the deficits in auditory
perception, affecting other cognitive functions.</p>

<p><strong>Depression</strong>
</p>
<p>Studies have also found that up to 20% of patients with presbycusis also
have symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>Depression and cognitive decline have an inherent two-way relationship,
with one worsening the other.</p>

to drive safely, when warning sounds are harder to hear.</p>
