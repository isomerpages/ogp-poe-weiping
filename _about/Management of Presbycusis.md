<p>Presbycusis is a natural part of aging, but early diagnosis and treatment
can improve quality of life by preserving communication abilities and reducing
the impact on daily activities.</p>
<p>Increased awareness of the potential complications of hearing loss has
placed increased importance on <strong>screening</strong> for hearing loss,
as treatment with devices such as <strong>hearing aids </strong>has been
shown to positively impact quality of life.</p>
<p>Where indicated, patients with severe-profound hearing loss not adequately
rehabilitated with hearing aids will also be recommended<strong> cochlear implantation </strong>by
Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Specialists.</p>
<p>Although research into the role of <strong>hearing rehabilitation</strong> in
preventing and even reversing the above complications of presbycusis is
preliminary, it is suggested that it does play an important part.</p>
<p><strong>To address the needs of individuals with presbycusis, early detection, appropriate referrals and access to interventions are crucial to ensure hearing care can be received in a timely manner.</strong>
