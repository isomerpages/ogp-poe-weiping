<p>A study based in the United States found that the risk of incident dementia
was 1.89 times higher in elderly with mild hearing loss, and 4.94 times
higher in elderly with severe hearing loss.</p>
<p>Locally, a longitudinal study involving 1,515 subjects found that among
participants who were cognitively normal at baseline, those with hearing
impairment were 2.3 times more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment
or dementia.</p>
<p>Although the mechanisms via which this occurs are not fully elucidated,
there are several proposed theories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social isolation may result in reduced cognitive stimulation, predisposing
one to decline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has also been proposed that hearing impairment requires the brain to
recruit finite neurologic reserve to make up for the deficits in auditory
perception, affecting other cognitive functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
