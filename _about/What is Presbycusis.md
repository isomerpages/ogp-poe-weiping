<p><strong>Presbycusis</strong> is the medical term for age-related hearing
loss. It is a gradual, progressive loss of hearing that occurs as people
age, typically starting around middle age and worsening over time. It usually
affects both ears equally and is an extremely common condition, affecting
up to 88% of Singaporean patients over the age of 60. With Singapore having
one of the highest life expectancies globally, this prevalence is expected
to rise.</p>
<p>The hearing loss associated with presbycusis can be mild, moderate or
severe-profound. It can also affect lower frequency or higher frequency
hearing.</p>
